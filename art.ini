; ART.INI
; This control file provides the information necessary to handle the
; artwork in Chronoshift. The information usually covers sprite
; animation and related characteristics. There is one section
; for each sprite data file. The sprite section names are unique
; within the system and are referred to by name in the RULES.INI
; control file.

; *** Infantry Sequences ***
; Infantry animations are grouped within a single art file.
; Unlike units, infantry animation layout is completely
; arbitrary and must be explicitly specified. Each
; infantry format file will be identified with one of these
; animation sequences.
;
; The first number is the starting frame number. The second
; number is the number of frames of the animation. If this
; number is zero then the anim sequence is not present.
; The third number is the multiplier by the infantry facing
; to reach the facing specific animation start. If this
; last number is zero, then there is no facing specific
; version.
;
; Ready = standing around
; Guard = standing around with weapon drawn
; Prone = while prone
; Walk = walking [normal movement]
; FireUp = firing while standing
; Down = transition from standing to prone
; Crawl = moving while prone
; Up = transition from prone to standing
; FireProne = firing while prone
; Idle1 = idle animation sequence #1
; Idle2 = idle animation sequence #2
; Die1 = death animation when hit by gunfire
; Die2 = death animation when exploding
; Die3 = death animation when exploding (alternate)
; Die4 = death animation by concussion explosion
; Die5 = death animatino by fire
